## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- According to the results, the multi linear model is:
mpg = 6.27 * vehicle_length + 1.25e-3 * vehicle_weigth + 6.88e-2 * spoiler_angle -3.41 * AWD + 3.55 * ground_clearance - 1.04e+2
- therefore we have
mpg = 6.27 * vehicle_length - 3.41 * AWD + 3.55 * ground_clearance - 104.

The slope of the linear model can't be considered to be zero.
R-square is 0.71  of the variations in mpg can be explained by changes in the vehicle length the spoiler angle, the drivetrain and the ground clearance. Our model can be assess as fairly efficient to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
